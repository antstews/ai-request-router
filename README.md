# üß† AI Request Router ‚Äî A No-Code Routing Assistant

This micro-project is part of a 14-day AI sprint exploring $0 automation solutions using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Power Platform, and GPT-based classification. **The AI Request Router** analyzes natural language queries submitted by internal users (e.g., ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt access my pay stub‚Äù) and routes them to the correct team: HR, IT, Facilities, Finance, or Escalation.

It uses a combination of keyword logic and a smart classifier prompt to turn messy text into structured decisions‚Äîautomatically.

## üöÄ What It Does

- Accepts incoming form/email/text requests from users  
- Attempts category classification via keyword match  
- Falls back to GPT-based analysis if unclear  
- Responds with a confirmation email or message  
- Logs the request with category, confidence, and explanation  
- Routes the request to the right team inbox or system

---

## üß© Built With

- Power Automate (free-tier logic flows)  
- OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API (for natural language classification)  
- Markdown + Obsidian (for system modeling & documentation)  
- Optionally SharePoint or Excel for request logs

## ‚úçÔ∏è Why I Built This

Internal operations are overloaded with requests‚Äîand most aren‚Äôt urgent, just misrouted. This workflow proves that even without infrastructure or engineering resources, *you can build intelligent routing systems using free tools and smart prompt design.* It‚Äôs also a warm-up for deeper sprint projects focused on cybersecurity and Copilot UX.

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Add UI to simulate input form or inbox  
- Improve prompt with role or urgency detection  
- Integrate with Microsoft Teams or Slack for alerts  
- Add metrics to track routing accuracy over time
